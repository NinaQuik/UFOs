# UFOs
## Overview
This project uses JavaScript, HTML and CSS to build a dynamic page that displays a table of UFO sightings that were reported during two weeks of 2010.  The UFO sighting data is stored in a JavaScript array, which is then read into an HTML table.  JavaScript is utilized to allow users to filter the table based on attributes of the UFO sightings.

### Tools
- Bootstrap 4.0
- DS.js 4.11

## Results

The page is loaded with a blurb about UFO sightings and a table containing all 111 records stored in the data.js file.
